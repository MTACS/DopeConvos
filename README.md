# DopeConvos FAQ

**Dependencies which are required in order to install DopeConvos:**
*Cephei - https://repo.chariz.com
libimagepicker - https://repo.packix.com
libsparkcolourpicker - https://sparkdev.me/repo*

Q: I am installing it but nothing is showing up in settings
A: Try adding https://rpetri.ch/repo and update PreferenceLoader

Q: My unread indicators are not showing up
A: This is intentional as DopeConvos uses its own images to display a more modern look to all indicator images, these can be activated from DopeConvos>Conversations you can change the color of them and the size as well

Q: Pictures are not showing up when using a UI theme
A: Activate Disable Mask On Images in DopeConvos>Bubbles

Q: My iMessage games are not allowing me to respond to them
A: Activate Disable Mask On Images in DopeConvos>Bubbles

Q: I’m showing a box behind my message bubbles when using a UI theme
A: Message Bubble UI themes require the gradient fill to be removed in order to remove the box underneath the bubbles, activate enableUITheming in DopeConvos>Bubbles and DopeConvos will use the Bottom Gradient Color to color the bubbles (obviously gradient colors will not work)

Q: Why do some UI themes work with gradient fill but others don’t
A: Some message bubbles UI themes use a transparent fill or only partially theme the bubble mask, while others use a full mask allowing for iOS to properly theme with no additional steps

Q: My Message Bubbles have a weird pixelated image displaying on them
A: This is due to the UI theme and you need to enableUITheming in DopeConvos>Bubbles

Q: Is there any way to make the blurred backgrounds stay dark?
A: Yes, Choose Consistent Dark for the blur style

Q: I’ve imported my Preset but it’s not working
A: The developer of ColorizeChat was kind enough to share his Presets for use in DopeConvos, follow his tutorial for getting Presets working fine: [Presets Tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSthemes/comments/fpbmmx/discussion_colorizechat_import_setups_please_read/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)
